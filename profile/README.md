# Laboratory Biomarkers and Machine Learning
Development of a Machine Learning model for the prognosis of COVID-19 in terms of SEVERITY using laboratory biomarkers. The data are from examinations of patients treated at the Hospital de Clínicas of the Federal University of Paraná.

# Objective
Develop a Machine Learning model to predict the severity of COVID-19 and identify biomarkers associated with this severity in order to optimize priority in hospital care.
